Describe which technologies were used and the role of each in your project. 
I used the following technologies `html`, `css`, and `JavaScript`

## Setup
The app is easy to use. Open the link, it takes you right to the app. Write your tasks into the input field, and then click the "lisää" button. You can write as many as you want. When you are ready with your task, click the "Valmis" button and it will draw a line over the task. You can also delete the task with the "Poista" button.
